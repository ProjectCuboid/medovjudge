Yep! **Medovjudge** is a repo for some problems' solutions.
solutions are with .cpp file and a binary.
list.txt is timestamps in this format `dd/mm/yy/HH/MM`.
MakeFile is for easier logging / compiling, `make all p="problemnum"` for build, and `make runall p="problemnum"` for running after compiling.
